Neural-net music suggestions — Keras deep learning, SciKit ensemble techniques, &amp; Spotify feature API  
&nbsp;  
&nbsp;  
Built for IEEE CS Fall 2021 Data Science Sprint

## problem

Music streaming services such as Spotifywork on algorithms to predict and
recommend which new music you might enjoy based on what kinds of music you
already listen to; however, the recommendations are not always accurate enough for
one’s specific tastes. Can you train a model which offers better suggestions?

### pivot

Build a genre classifier instead.

## approach

Use the Spotify API to get a sample of thecurrent user’s preferred tracks
from their library, or one of their playlists (to get more fine-tuned suggestions based on a
specific playlist/genre). Assign a preference score to each track (clarification: not
manually, but via algorithm), rating it with a weighted combination of global popularity,
frequency in library/playlists, relevance to user’s “top” artists and tracks, etc. (to improve
the model’s accuracy, add more personal factors to this score, ie. user-specific play
count (not currently available)). Use the Spotify API to get information on the features of
the tracks selected. Choose one/many types of classifiers to use (ie. RandomForest),
then train your model to predict an accurate preference score for each track based on
its provided feature information. Finally, use the Spotify API to obtain a large random
sampling of tracks, feed their feature information into the model, and select the tracks
with the highest estimated preference score as the official suggestions. Optionally, build
a website to provide public music recommendations from your model.
